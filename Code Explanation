Code Explanation:

This code creates a simple Grocery Billing System using Tkinter, a Python GUI library. Let’s break down the code:

Import Statements: The code starts by importing necessary modules – tkinter for GUI and random for generating random bill numbers.

Class Definition: The Bill_App class is defined, which serves as the main application class.

Initialization: In the __init__ method of the class, the GUI window is configured with a specific size, title, and components.

Variable Initialization: Several StringVar and IntVar variables are initialized to hold customer details and the quantity of various items purchased.

GUI Layout:

The layout is organized using Label, Entry, and LabelFrame widgets to represent different sections such as customer details, food items, grocery items, others, bill area, and buttons.
Each section contains labels and entry fields to input data.
Functions:

total: Calculates the total prices for food, grocery, and other items, along with their respective taxes.
welcome_soft: Updates the text area with customer details and a header for the bill list.
clear: Clears the bill area.
bill_area: Adds product names, quantities, and prices to the bill area.
exit: Closes the application window.
Main Execution:

It creates an instance of the Tk class to create the application window.
An object of the Bill_App class is created, passing the Tk instance.
The mainloop() method is called to start the GUI event loop.
